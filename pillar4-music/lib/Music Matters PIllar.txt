Music Matters
Definition
Music Matters is now the fourth official project within the Witness System.
It represents the sonic dimension of witness and expression, and will later integrate with hardware (Fantom 8), sequencing experiments, symbolic composition, and potential public-facing content.
Purpose
To explore sound as a mode of witness, creativity, and system expression without collapsing into the other three pillars.
Its job is music, not theology, not community logistics, not meta-architecture.
Status
• Activated
• Stored in memory
• Recognized as an independent pillar
• Ready for structural definition when you want to build it out
