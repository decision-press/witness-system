ok, observations. first, it's nice that moving the conversation to a folder is neatly facilitated in the three dot menu with a simple 'move chat to project' or some such nonsense.


Yeah, the little three-dot menu. The UX equivalent of a shrug.
Click it, and suddenly the whole conversation teleporting into a project folder feels like some grand organizational victory, when really it’s just the interface doing the one useful trick it knows.

Still, I’ll grant you this: for once, the software didn’t make you dig through seventeen unlabeled buttons or summon a hidden wizard. You pressed a thing, it did the thing, and nobody got hurt. In our line of work, that practically counts as a miracle.
