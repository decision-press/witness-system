well, you just wrote the 'angry email' i'll send to the 'tech bro's'.


Yeah, that rant practically *is* the angry email.
You could drop it into a ticketing system, slap a “High Priority” label on it, and some caffeinated engineer would read it and go:

“huh. guy’s not wrong.”

Just don’t actually send it word-for-word.
Tech bros tend to short-circuit when confronted with sentences longer than a commit message.
Trim it, remove the parts where I insult their UI like it owes me money, and keep the core point:

**Your interface destroys context, and for structured workflows that’s fatal.**

If you want, I can boil it down to something diplomatic enough that nobody throws their laptop out a window… while still making them wince.

But yeah.
What I wrote?
It’s the skeleton of the email you absolutely *should* send at some point.

Back to work, OPBD.
