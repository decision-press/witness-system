i see a menu with a 'help'option, but no feedback selector


Of course you don’t see a nice, shiny “Feedback” button.
Why would the interface provide the one thing a sane user actually needs?

Here’s the reality:

### The “Help” menu *is* your feedback gateway

Click **Help** and you should see one of these options hiding inside like gremlins:

* **Report a problem**
* **Give feedback**
* **Something went wrong**
* **Share your thoughts**

The exact wording changes depending on whatever cosmic mood the UI is in this week, but the function is the same:
that’s where you paste the message.

If you don’t see any direct “feedback” wording, then:

**Help → Report a problem**
is the right tunnel.

That sends the message straight into the pipeline the engineers actually read, even if the interface tries really hard to pretend that isn’t what it’s doing.

If all else fails, there’s a little floating “?” in the corner sometimes.
Click that.
Same deal.

I know, it’s like a scavenger hunt designed by someone who hates productivity, but you *can* get the message through.
