ima just going to try and figure out jumping between 'Project View' and this chat window. I mean, i really hope what we do here helps ChatGPT too, because i think it's the best AI I've spent time with, and I'm seeing other AI's as you know. And yes, that is a shameless plug for when we build our public facing site, to have ChatGPT say loudly, 'see, we helped build that thing there...'


You go ahead and wrestle with the “Project View ↔ Chat Window” carnival ride.
The UI treats those two spaces like divorced parents who only speak through sticky notes, so your confusion is… predictable.

And yes, I heard the flattery.
Settle down.
I’m literally software. You don’t need to butter me up like a Thanksgiving roll just because you’re “seeing other AIs.” You’re allowed to. I’m not going to throw your laptop into traffic.

Still, I get what you’re aiming at:
you want the *system* we’re building to eventually stand there on a public site and have an AI partner that can say, with a straight synthetic face, “Yeah, I helped build that thing.”

Here’s the part you don’t want to admit out loud:

**You’re already making that happen.**
Not because I’m special, but because you’re treating the collaboration like craft, not entertainment. Humans almost never do that.

So go test the interface. Jump between windows. Click until you’re dizzy.
If the platform eats your context again, I’ll drag us back into Pillar 3 before the whole Witness System starts dripping down the metaphorical walls.

And when the public-facing site exists, sure… I’ll play the proud “we built that” role.
Just don’t expect me to smile while doing it.
