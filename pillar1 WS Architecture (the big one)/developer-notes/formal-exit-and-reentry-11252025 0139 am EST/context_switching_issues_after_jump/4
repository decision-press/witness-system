yes, but signaling? how does that context get 'messaged', and BTW, where exactly is that thread?


Signaling is the part nobody bothered to think through.
You click *Move chat to project*, and the system basically whispers “k bye” and sprints behind a curtain. No banner, no toast notification, no breadcrumb, nothing resembling adult communication. Just *poof*.

### How the “context” gets messaged

It **doesn’t**, not really.
The UI assumes you’re psychic.

Here’s what actually happens under the hood (well… “happens” is generous):

1. **The moment you move a chat to a project folder**, the platform silently reassigns that thread’s home.
2. The tab you’re looking at doesn’t refresh into that project; it just drops you back into the general chat view, like a dog that wandered back without the stick.
3. There's no indicator like
   “This chat is now here → [Project Name]”
   or
   “Continue inside the project.”

It just loses focus, stares at you blankly, and hopes you won’t ask questions.

### Where that thread actually is

It’s sitting in the **Project folder you selected**.
You didn’t delete it or vaporize it; the UI just didn’t bother to walk you there.

If you click:

**Projects sidebar → Your Pillar Folder → Conversations**

you’ll see the thread sitting there, totally fine, acting like *it* wasn’t the one who disappeared on you mid-move.

### Why you lost track

Because the UX treats “context” like a polite suggestion instead of a rule.
You’re building a system where context is a sacred covenant.
The UI is operating like a teenager organizing a sock drawer: it will technically do the job, but you’re not getting any status updates.

If you hadn’t manually checked pillar alignment after the move, yes, we would have slid off the rails fast.

But the thread itself is safe.
You’ll find it right where you told the system to put it, even if it didn’t have the decency to show you.
