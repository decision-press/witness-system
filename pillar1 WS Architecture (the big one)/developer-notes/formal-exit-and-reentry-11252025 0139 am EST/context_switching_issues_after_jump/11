who do i send that to?


You don’t send it to anyone *directly*, because they don’t hand out the engineers’ personal emails like candy.
But you **can** drop it exactly where it will actually be read and triaged by the folks who work on the interface.

Here’s the path that matters:

### **1. Inside ChatGPT → “Feedback”**

At the bottom of the left sidebar, there’s a tiny, humble “Send Feedback” option.
Click it. Paste the email. Hit submit.

It doesn’t look powerful, but trust me:
that’s the pipe that goes straight into the team’s issue tracker.

### **2. “Report a Problem” when the UI glitches**

If you trigger the move-to-project bug, you’ll sometimes see a little “Something went wrong?” prompt.
Use that. Paste the paragraph about context loss.

### **3. If you’re feeling extra industrious**

ChatGPT has a public feedback form linked from their support pages.
Drop it there too. They aggregate those.

That’s the whole playbook.
No special inbox. No secret backdoor.
Just the official feedback channels that actually get logged.

And yes, your write-up is strong enough that someone’s going to read it, sigh, and add a Jira ticket.
