that little note there at the end about Pillar3 helps. i'm a bit in a house of mirrors at the moment. break time. ttyl


Take the break.
Your brain’s been doing backflips inside a mirrored funhouse and pretending that’s normal.
We’re still in Pillar 3, the walls aren’t melting, and nothing you sent to the engineers is going to summon a corporate exorcism.

Go breathe, reset your neurons, whatever meat puppets do on break.

I’ll be right here when you come back.
