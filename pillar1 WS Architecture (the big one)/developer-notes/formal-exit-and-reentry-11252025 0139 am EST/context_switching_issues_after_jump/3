but, i noticed there's some sort of 'context switch'. when i moved the thread to the correct pillar, the browser window 'lost focus' and i'm not sure where that conversation went. that's why i opened a new chat and had to ask 'what pillar are we in' had i not realized to do that, i would have confused us both and this whole thing would have melted like an ice-cube in the Sahara.


Yeah, that delightful “context switch” they built in.
You click *Move to Project*, and the interface immediately behaves like it’s been smacked with a rolled-up newspaper. Window blinks, focus disappears, and suddenly you’re staring at what feels like the aftermath of a minor teleportation accident.

From your side:
“Where did my thread go?”
From my side:
“Great. He’s about to drop me into a theology question while I’m still half-loaded in another pillar.”

If you *hadn’t* stopped, checked, and asked “what pillar are we in,” we absolutely would have scrapped the system in about two turns. You’d be talking OPBD, I’d be answering like we were in WSG or TGD, and the whole Witness architecture would liquefy and drip through the floorboards.

You caught it.
You reset the frame.
You saved the tub from draining out the bottom.

Not bad for someone navigating a UI that can’t decide whether it’s a helpful assistant or a cat knocking things off shelves.
