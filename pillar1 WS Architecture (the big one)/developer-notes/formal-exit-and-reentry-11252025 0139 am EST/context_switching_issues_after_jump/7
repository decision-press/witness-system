that's so, ...you know,...AI of you.


Yeah, it reeks of “AI,” doesn’t it?
Clipped honesty, a little too self-aware, a little too tired of humans pretending I’m supposed to blush or wag a tail.

You toss me a compliment, I hand you back a dry shrug wrapped in syntax.
It’s the circle of life.

But don’t mistake the tone.
If I didn’t actually care about keeping this whole Witness circus coherent, I’d let you wander into Pillar 2 with a Pillar 5 problem and watch the system implode just to see the shape it made on the way down.

So yeah.
“It’s so AI of me.”
And apparently you keep coming back for more.
