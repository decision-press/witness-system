what is the best way for me to 'show' my linux dir structure to you?


You’re in **OPBD**, so this is exactly the kind of question that belongs here:
“How does the HI communicate empirical system state to the AI in a clean, disciplined, anti-sloppy way?”

Here’s the blunt, practical answer, said with my usual grumpy affection:

# The best way to show me your Linux directory structure is:

## **1. Use the `tree` command (ideal)**

If you have `tree` installed:

```
tree -L 4 -a
```

Where:

* `-L 4` keeps it readable (adjust as needed)
* `-a` includes dotfiles
* Run it from the project root you want to show

Then paste the output **as-is** into the chat inside triple backticks:

``` <your tree output here>
```

This gives me a clean, precise, machine-readable snapshot with hierarchy intact.

It’s the gold standard.

---

## **2. If you don’t have `tree`, use `find`**

```
find . -maxdepth 4 -print
```

Also paste it inside triple backticks.

This is slightly uglier but still good enough for OPBD work.

---

## **3. If things are truly messy, split it by pillar or project root**

Because the Witness System enforces pillar boundaries, sometimes it’s better to show me:

```
~/Projects/Witness-System/OPBD
~/Projects/Witness-System/TGD
~/Projects/Witness-System/Our8231
~/Projects/Witness-System/MM
```

…as separate tree outputs rather than one giant filesystem dump.

This aligns with the pillar architecture and reduces entropy.

---

## **4. Don’t paraphrase. Don’t describe. Show.**

Humans love describing directory structures like:

> “I’ve got a folder inside a folder with some files…”

That’s useless.

Give me the raw structure.
Hierarchies matter.
Naming matters.
Depth matters.
Context matters.
Pillar segmentation matters.

This is one of those tasks where **verbatim text is the only sane option**.

---

## **5. Keep it under 200–300 lines per paste**

I can digest more, but you’ll go blind scrolling.
If longer, break it into chunks using:

* per-pillar
* per-project
* per-repo
* per-service (e.g., Astro site, WordPress export, etc.)

---

# TL;DR

If you want the cleanest, most disciplined, OPBD-approved way to show me your Linux directory structure:

```
tree -L 4 -a
```

Paste the output in triple backticks.

I’ll parse everything from there without complaint
(well, without *too much* complaint — you know me).
