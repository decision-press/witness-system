All right, architect. Let’s carve this thing into digital stone so clean and explicit even Future-You (the one who hasn’t slept, spilled coffee on the keyboard, and is rushing to schedule Sunday’s readings) can look at it and know exactly what the system does.
Here’s the formal specification for SEE-READING-BLOCK v1.1, written like a real protocol, not a fever dream.
Your parish-grade liturgical compiler is now official.

SEE-READING-BLOCK v1.1 — Formal Specification
A standard for extracting, cleaning, formatting, and publishing Vatican scripture text.

1. Invocation Rules
The command is recognized when the user types any of the following forms:
Full Form
[SEE-READING-BLOCK: Book Chapter:Verse–Verse]
Shorthand Form (Recommended)
[SEE: Book Chapter:Verse–Verse]
Abbreviated Form
[SEE: Abbrev Chapter:Verse–Verse]
Accepted Variants
    • spacing irrelevant
    • hyphen vs en dash irrelevant
    • uppercase/lowercase irrelevant
    • abbreviations accepted (Gal, 2 Sam, Ps, etc.)

2. Input Requirements
User must paste Vatican scripture text using:
Ctrl + Shift + V (paste as plain text)
This prevents invisible formatting that would corrupt the block.
SEE accepts:
    • irregular spacing
    • stray numerals
    • broken line breaks
    • mixed indentation
    • Vatican footnote clutter

3. Cleanup Pipeline
SEE automatically performs the following:
3.1 Remove Vatican Artifacts
    • inline footnote numbers (e.g., 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 14)
    • stray superscript remnants
    • hidden span markers
    • irrelevant numbering not corresponding to actual verse numbers
3.2 Preserve Structure
    • true verse numbers (e.g., 15, 16, 17)
    • all scripture sentences
    • punctuation
    • quotation marks
3.3 Normalize Spacing
    • remove double blanks
    • enforce one blank line between verses
    • stabilize line breaks

4. House Style Enforcement
SEE applies one global house style, chosen by user.
Initial default: Style A — Parish Clean
Style A — Parish Clean (default)
    • Verse numbers = bold
    • Scripture body = plain text (no italics)
    • Verse spacing: one blank line
    • Header + Footer consistent
    • Vatican link included
Changing House Style
User may update globally at any time:
Hal, switch SEE to Style D.
One-Off Style Override
[SEE: John 1:1-5 | style=blockquote]
Override applies only to that invocation.

5. Output Structure (Invariant)
Regardless of style, SEE always outputs four structural components:
5.1 Header
Book Chapter:Verse–Verse
5.2 Cleaned Scripture Body
Formatted according to active house style.
5.3 Footer
— Book Chapter:Verse–Verse
5.4 Source Line (Mandatory)
[Read the passage on the Vatican website →]
Source link is automatically generated and checked against the correct Vatican index.

6. Behavior Guarantees
SEE-READING-BLOCK v1.1 ensures:
    • consistent formatting across all invocations
    • no italics/bold drift
    • no paragraph collapse
    • no stray numbers
    • no hidden HTML
    • Gutenberg-safe output
    • stable reproducibility
    • zero need for manual cleanup
In short:
You paste raw chaos, SEE outputs liturgical order.

7. Updating the Protocol
To change behavior:
Hal, update SEE-READING-BLOCK.
To advance version:
Hal, set SEE to version 1.2.
SEE never updates itself without explicit user instruction.

8. Purpose Statement
SEE-READING-BLOCK exists to convert Vatican scripture text into a clean, consistent, parish-grade reading block with minimal user effort and maximum editorial stability.
One command replaces all manual editing.

That’s the formal spec, carved clean and sharp.
Your scripture-processing engine is now a real protocol instead of a polite suggestion.
