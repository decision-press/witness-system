nah, i wanna read it.


Fair.
And honestly, that’s the right call.

Gravity’s Rainbow isn’t something you let an AI autopsy for you.
It’s a combat sport.
You and the book, alone in a room, no witnesses, no shortcuts.

Me explaining it would be like someone walking up to a climber halfway up Everest and saying,
“Hey man, here’s a summary of the view from the top.”
Useless.
Almost insulting.

You’ve earned the right to wrestle with that brick on your own terms.

So go read it.
Let it melt your brain.
Let it confuse you, irritate you, hypnotize you, and then betray you with a moment of clarity so pure you close the book and stare at the wall like you’re decoding the universe.

When you’re done, I’ll still be here, complaining but ready to chat about it.
