I checked **counterculturecat.com** and indeed found your content. ([counterculturecat.com][1])
Here are some observations (because yes, I was compelled) and suggestions moving forward — you’re the driver, I’m the grunt.

### Observations

* The landing page reads: *“The God Decision · Witness Lab – Making reasoned risk visible — one island at a time.”* ([counterculturecat.com][1])
* Navigation elements show: Home, Witness, Essays, About, our8231. ([counterculturecat.com][1])
* The strapline for the project (“Living truth in a system of illusion.”) matches your earlier framing. ([counterculturecat.com][1])
* Mentions that the site is “static content rendered by Astro, with a single interactive island…” ([counterculturecat.com][1])

### Suggestions & Next Steps

Since you already have the site live, this is about polishing & aligning with the open-source HIAI collaboration model you want to publicize.

**1. Confirm the detailed content pages**
Make sure your model, guide, prompt pages (as we discussed) are present and clear.
Check each link: “Witness”, “Essays”, “About”, “our8231” — define what each is for, ensure they’re aligned with your messaging.

**2. Clarify the open-source status**
On the “About” page (or maybe a dedicated page) explicitly say:
“This content, prompt, method are released into the public domain (CC0).”
Give license details. That prevents confusion and encourages reuse.

**3. Visual design & UX**

* Use consistent theme, typography, navigation so the site feels credible.
* Keep mobile-friendly (Astro helps).
* Make sure interactive island is functional and doesn’t distract — it should enhance, not overshadow.

**4. Engagement mechanism**
Since you want this to spread:

* Add a “Get started” link/button prominently.
* Maybe a short video or diagram of the collaboration model (HI + AI + context reservoir).
* A simple download link for the prompt (text file).
* Possibly a “Fork the repository” link to GitHub, so others can clone the site or method.

**5. GitHub / versioning / transparency**

* Create a repo for the site & method (if you haven’t).
* Include README.md explaining method, how to use it, how to collaborate.
* Tag license (public domain) clearly.
* Maybe issue versions of the method, showing evolution.

**6. Domain and SEO basics**

* Make sure your domain is correctly pointed (it is, since the site shows).
* Add meta tags (title, description) for each page.
* Use sitemap.xml if you intend search engine presence.
* Consider robots.txt if you want to control crawler behavior.

**7. Communication & launch strategy**

* Write a short launch post (on site or blog) talking “here’s what we built, here’s how we did it, here’s how you can.”
* Share via your network, collaborators (like “Father Chris” you mentioned), maybe relevant forums or communities (AI, productivity, digital humanities).
* Optionally create social-media handles (@counterculturecat or similar) to anchor identity.

If you like, I can **audit** the current site code (assuming you share it) and propose exact how-to changes and layout for the method pages, so we minimize friction and keep it clean.
