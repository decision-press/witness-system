“We are entering Pillar 2 – The God Decision.”


Good. Pillar 2 activated.

You just stepped back into the domain of:
• theology
• scripture
• metaphysics
• meaning
• faith
• moral structure

The air gets thinner up here, but at least we’re not tripping over postmodern rockets anymore.

Alright.
We are in **The God Decision**.

What part of the Bible do you want to explore inside this pillar?
