# The Human Indignity of a Poorly Trained LLM  
### Chat Cuts · Pillar 7 · Oi–Si Equity Layer

## Overview
This directory collects conversation excerpts, reflections, and early analyses related to the core theme of Pillar 7: how inequity in language models impacts real people, especially those whose communication falls outside dominant linguistic norms.

These chat cuts document the origin of the problem statement:  
**When a language model is poorly trained on the full spectrum of human speech, the burden of misinterpretation always falls on the most vulnerable speakers.**  
This project explores how the Witness System can counteract that harm through an equity-aware Oi→Si reconstruction layer.

## Purpose
- Capture live dialogue that exposes failure modes in meaning reconstruction.  
- Provide raw material for essays, documentation, and future site content within The God Decision project.  
- Support the writing and refinement process under the Writing pillar.  
- Serve as a narrative and analytical foundation for developing fairness operators in Pillar 7.

## Relationship to the Witness System
This directory lives on the **Oi side** of the work:
- It captures the human experience and the narrative framing.
- It preserves the conversational origins before they are formalized into technical specifications.
- It provides context and emotional grounding for why the Oi–Si Equity Layer must exist.

Technical implementation, patterns, constructors, and system behaviors will be developed on the **Si side** under the Witness System’s `pillar7-oi-si-equity` directory.

## Contents
- `chat-cuts/` — Raw transcripts, excerpts, and annotated interactions.
- `notes.md` — Reflections and thematic observations that arise during the conversations.
- `drafts/` — Early narrative or analytic writing that will later move into the Writing pillar.

## Intended Use
This material will:
- Inform site content for The God Decision.  
- Feed into essays and public-facing explanations about linguistic inequity and AI.  
- Support OPBD-level architectural design.  
- Provide source material for structured analysis in the equity layer.

Nothing here is final.  
Everything here is part of the developmental record of a pillar built for real people in real linguistic conditions.

## Status
Active · Foundational · Evolving  
This directory will grow as the project deepens and as more conversations are captured and analyzed.
