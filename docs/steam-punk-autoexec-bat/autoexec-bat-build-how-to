You want to give the witness-system an `AUTOEXEC.BAT` and immortalize it in git. Good. Finally some ritual we can point at instead of keeping it all in your head.

Let’s do a v0 that’s simple, real, and pushable.

---

## 1. Where these files live

I’d suggest:

* `~/Projects/witness-system/docs/autoexec-witness.md`
* `~/Projects/witness-system/bin/wit-boot` (or `witness-boot.sh` if you like the 90s)

That gives you:

* One **human-facing boot document**
* One **shell helper** that reminds you of the ritual and sets context

---

## 2. `docs/autoexec-witness.md` (v0.1)

Here’s a first version you can drop straight in.
Tone is clean & operational on purpose:

````markdown
# Witness-System Autoexec (v0.1)

**File:** `docs/autoexec-witness.md`  
**Purpose:** Define a repeatable boot sequence for the operator + witness-system on a Linux box.  
**Scope:** Human discipline + directory structure + constructor usage. No magic.

---

## 0. Intent & scope check

Before touching the keyboard:

1. State today’s **primary intent** in one sentence.  
   - Example: “Clarify Pillar 3 protocols for collaboration” or “Work on Astro layout for public site.”
2. Confirm **this session is part of the witness-system** (not casual chat, not random browsing).
3. If the intent doesn’t belong in any pillar, do not start a witness session.

---

## 1. Environment

**Assumed environment:**

- OS: Linux
- Root repo: `~/Projects/witness-system` (or equivalent)
- Version control: `git`
- Editor: any (vim, nano, VS Code, etc.)

**Required directories (conceptual):**

- `constructor/` – canonical constructor text & versions  
- `pillars/` – pillar-specific docs, guides, workflows  
- `logs/` – transcripts, notes, session artifacts  
- `meta/` (optional) – governance, decisions, design notes  

Adjust naming to match the actual repo, but keep the roles stable.

---

## 2. Mode & color-state

The witness-system uses simple modes:

- **grey** – no pillar active; general/meta orientation only  
- **green** – a specific pillar is active and in-bounds  
- (Other colors may be defined later; green is the normal “in pillar” state.)

**Rule:**  
Do not mix pillars. One active pillar per session or sub-session.

---

## 3. Boot sequence (human ritual)

1. **Open terminal & set root**

   ```bash
   cd ~/Projects/witness-system
````

2. **Pull latest changes**

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

3. **Confirm today’s intent (from Section 0) is still valid.**
   If it changed, restate it.

4. **Select pillar (if any):**

   Example:

   * Pillar 3 – Open the Pod Bay Door (OPBD) for collaboration / epistemic protocols
   * ASTRO-DEV pillar for web dev work
   * etc.

   Record the selected pillar at the top of your working note for the day.

5. **Set initial mode:**

   * Start in **grey**.
   * Only switch to **green** when you explicitly “enter” a pillar.

6. **Locate the current constructor**

   Example convention:

   * `constructor/CONSTRUCTOR-current.md` → symlink or pointer to latest version
   * Versioned files: `constructor/constructor-v2.1.3.md`, etc.

   The current witness session uses the canonical constructor text from this file.

---

## 4. Chat session initialization

When starting a fresh session with the model:

1. **Load the constructor text** from the canonical file.
2. **Instantiate the constructor** as the first move in the session.
3. **Declare pillar and mode** at the top of the session, explicitly.

Example (human side, conceptual):

* “Context: witness-system / Pillar 3 – OPBD / mode: grey”
* Then instantiate constructor.
* Then explicitly:

  * `enter pillar3-OPBD` (or equivalent command string)
  * Model acknowledges and confirms green-state.

---

## 5. Logging & artifacts

Each substantial session should produce a durable trace.

**Minimum:**

1. Create or append to a log file for the day, e.g.:

   * `logs/2025-11-26-pillar3-OPBD.md`

2. Capture key elements:

   * Date / time
   * Pillar
   * Intent
   * Major decisions or conclusions
   * Pointers to any created files or branches

3. For especially important exchanges, copy the relevant snippets from the chat into a log file in `logs/` or into the pillar’s own directory.

---

## 6. Drift-detection routine

At natural checkpoints (or when something feels “off”):

1. Re-state:

   * Pillar
   * Intent
   * Mode (grey / green)
2. Ask:

   * Is the current topic still in-bounds for this pillar?
   * Are we still following the constructor rules?
3. If drift is detected:

   * Stop.
   * Note the drift in the log.
   * Either:

     * Recover by restating scope, or
     * Explicitly exit the pillar / session.

---

## 7. Exit sequence

When closing a work block:

1. Summarize in 3–5 bullet points:

   * What was decided
   * What was created
   * What is still open

2. Save all edited files and run:

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

3. Stage and commit if appropriate:

   ```bash
   git add <relevant files>
   git commit -m "Session log + updates for <pillar> on <YYYY-MM-DD>"
   git push
   ```

4. Explicitly “exit” the pillar in the chat (e.g. `exit pillar3-OPBD`), returning to **grey**.

---

## 8. Versioning this autoexec

* This file is **v0.1**.
* Changes to the ritual should be:

  * Documented in a short changelog at the bottom.
  * Committed with clear messages.

### Changelog

* **v0.1** – Initial definition of witness-system autoexec:

  * Intent check
  * Environment assumptions
  * Mode & color-state
  * Boot, logging, drift, and exit routines

````

That gives you a stable, boring, reproducible “operator boot file.” Exactly what this wants to be.

---

## 3. `bin/wit-boot` helper script

Now a small shell script that just:

- Sets `WIT_ROOT`
- Moves you there
- Prints the core steps as a reminder

Drop this into `bin/wit-boot` and `chmod +x` it:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Witness-System Autoexec helper (v0.1)

set -e

# Adjust this if your path is different
export WIT_ROOT="$HOME/Projects/witness-system"

cd "$WIT_ROOT"

echo "======================================="
echo "  Witness-System Autoexec (v0.1)"
echo "  Root: $WIT_ROOT"
echo "======================================="
echo
echo "0) State intent for this session."
echo "1) Confirm this work is in-scope for the witness-system."
echo "2) Select pillar (or stay in grey if orienting)."
echo "3) Open constructor file:"
echo "     constructor/CONSTRUCTOR-current.md"
echo "4) Start a new model session:"
echo "     - Instantiate constructor"
echo "     - Declare pillar + mode"
echo "5) Log session in logs/YYYY-MM-DD-<pillar>.md as needed."
echo
echo "When done:"
echo "  - Summarize outcomes"
echo "  - git status / git add / git commit / git push"
echo

# Optional: launch editor or file browser on the repo
# exec "$SHELL"
````

Make it executable:

```bash
cd ~/Projects/witness-system
mkdir -p bin docs
chmod +x bin/wit-boot
```

Then you can start your day with:

```bash
~/Projects/witness-system/bin/wit-boot
```

and let it nag you into discipline.

---

## 4. Commit & push

Once those files are created:

```bash
cd ~/Projects/witness-system

git add docs/autoexec-witness.md bin/wit-boot
git commit -m "Add witness-system autoexec doc and boot helper (v0.1)"
git push
```

There. You now have an actual, concrete autoexec for the witness-system, not just a vibe in your head. Which, frankly, is overdue.
