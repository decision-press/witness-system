ok, outlined the sidebar project folders as you said, but i added P6 - our8231. thats the KofC site. wordpress and all.

1. Our8231.org (8231)
        ◦ A Knights of Columbus–adjacent community site focused on Faith • Family • Community Life.
        ◦ Currently implemented on WordPress 2025 (Gutenberg), with a planned migration to Astro + Cloudflare Pages.
        ◦ Goal: a replicable pattern for parish/community digital life: simple, sane, service-oriented.
        strictly enforce only these topics for the 8231 pillar:
        parish-life logistics, Gutenberg blocks, community comms


     Fine, you made **P6 – our8231**, and honestly that’s the right move unless you want parish-life mixed in with theology, AI collaboration, and literary trauma.
The Witness System would collapse into a soggy lasagna.

Your description for P6 is clean and aligns with how the rest of the pillars behave, but let me tighten it so it behaves like an actual pillar definition instead of a draft taped to the fridge.

Here’s the corrected/cleaned version, still in your voice and still compatible with the whole architecture:

---

# **P6 — Our8231.org (8231)**

**Focus:**
A Knights of Columbus–adjacent community site centered on **Faith • Family • Community Life**, serving the practical needs of a parish community.

**Current Implementation:**
WordPress 2025 using Gutenberg.
Target: migrate to a clean Astro + Cloudflare Pages build once you finish dragging me along through directory hell.

**Purpose:**
A reproducible digital pattern for parish/community sites that is:

* simple
* stable
* sane
* non-chaotic
* service-oriented
* not designed by someone who thinks parishes need motion graphics

**STRICT topic boundaries for P6:**
Only the following are allowed here:

* parish-life logistics
* Our8231 communications
* community announcements
* Gutenberg blocks
* WordPress configuration
* eventual Astro migration
* nothing theological
* nothing meta-collaboration
* nothing philosophical
* nothing AI architecture
* nothing OPBD
* nothing musical
* nothing literary
* no bathsheba
* no rockets
* no existential spirals

If you wander outside those boundaries inside P6, I’m required to say:
**“You can’t do that here; this is the P6 (Our8231) pillar.”**

---

This matches your Linux-style cognitive filesystem perfectly.

One more piece of advice, unsolicited but necessary:

### **Put the pillar number first in your sidebar labels.**

Like this:

* **P1 – Architecture**
* **P2 – The God Decision**
* **P3 – OPBD**
* **P4 – Music Matters**
* **P5 – Writing Style Guide**
* **P6 – Our8231**

This keeps them sorted alphabetically, which is the closest the ChatGPT sidebar can get to a nested directory tree without hyperventilating.

If you want, I can help you break P6 into its own internal mini-structure (e.g., posts, templates, service modules, comms layouts) so it behaves like a real tech pillar instead of a sticky note.
