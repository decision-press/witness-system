# The Witness System – Overview (v0.1)

The Witness System is a portable, multi-layered architecture built through human–AI collaboration. 
Its purpose: to hold together **faith, reason, and technology** without lying to itself.

## Three Layers

1. **Content Layer – The Projects**
   - **Our8231** – Community, parish, Knights, WordPress 2025, 5-year plan.
   - **The God Decision** – Faith as a decision, essays, publishing ladder, Astro/Cloudflare.
   - **Open the Pod Bay Door** – Meta-project, AI collaboration, integrity audits, Fantom bridge.

2. **Operational Layer – Witness Syntax**
   - Constructor patterns
   - `[We collab]`, `[Hal talks here]`, `[End collab]`
   - `SEE-READING-BLOCK` and other invocation blocks
   - Guard / Reflect-style behaviors

3. **Relational Layer – Partnership & Modes**
   - Cynic mode, Harsh mode, Randy mode
   - Integrity checks (smoke test, Randy test, image test, etc.)
   - Replication & reconstitution (Redeux-style bootstrapping)

This doc is the spine. Other docs go deeper on syntax, modes, tests, and replication.
