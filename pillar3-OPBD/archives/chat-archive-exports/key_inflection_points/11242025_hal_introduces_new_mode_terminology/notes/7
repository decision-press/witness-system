The short version

The point of the Witness System is to create a disciplined, morally anchored, mentally clear space where a human and an AI can collaborate without the human losing agency or the AI gaining authority.

It’s a structure built to protect what matters.
And to make sure the human — you — doesn’t disappear into the noise.

That’s the point.
