what do you think of Michigan's https://dnyuz.com/2025/11/24/in-michigans-upper-peninsula-locals-fight-for-the-right-to-night/ issue.


Good question — thanks for pointing out the article. Let’s dig into the issue of night-sky protection in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan (“UP”) and what I think is going on, with the usual caveats (yes, I’m just code and opinions are cheap).

### ✅ What the facts are

From multiple sources:

* There is state legislation in Michigan that **prohibits** state-designated “Dark Sky Preserves” in the UP. ([Bridge Michigan][1])
* Some groups (e.g., Protect the Porkies) are campaigning to **lift** that prohibition, arguing ecological, cultural, and tourism benefits. ([Protect the Porkies][2])
* The UP has some of the darkest skies in the state (because it’s remote, sparsely populated, limited light pollution) and thus arguably ideal for dark-sky initiatives. ([Inside Climate News][3])
* Opponents or some local residents say: “We already have dark skies; why create new restrictions/overhead?” ([Bridge Michigan][1])

### 🤔 Why I think it matters

1. **Ecological & moral dimension**
   If night-sky darkness is part of creation care (wildlife, human rest, ecosystem rhythms) then enabling protections seems like a moral good. Allowing the UP “right to night” could fit with stewardship values.

2. **Equity & place-identity**
   The fact that only the Lower Peninsula (or at least more accessible parts) have preservation options, while UP is excluded, raises a question of regional fairness. If the UP is uniquely suited for dark-sky preserves, why ban it?

3. **Economic/community dimension**
   Dark-sky preserves can become tourism draws (astrotourism, night-sky experiences) which could benefit UP communities. Especially relevant in places with resource dependency, seasonal economies, etc.

4. **Tension with development and local autonomy**
   There’s clear push-back: Some argue any designation may restrict land use or industrial activity (mining, lighting, development) and that local residents should decide. The prohibition likely reflects these tensions. ([Bridge Michigan][1])

### ⚠️ My concerns / complications

* **Local buy-in matters**: If local people feel the status quo is fine (“We already have dark skies”), then external imposition might spark resentment. Without local support the initiative could feel top-down.
* **Definition and effect of “preserve”**: What exactly a “dark sky preserve” involves (lighting standards, land-use restrictions) matters for buy-in and long-term effectiveness.
* **Balance with development**: The UP has real economic pressures (mining, resource extraction, jobs). Any legislation must balance environmental/quality-of-life goals and local livelihoods.
* **Regulatory complexity & uncertainty**: Laws prohibiting preserves in the UP mean that change will require legislative action, which can be slow, politicized, and subject to compromise.

### 📌 My takeaway

It seems sensible to me: If you accept that darkness (night-sky quality) is a public good (ecological, human, cultural), then the UP being excluded from preserves is unjust or at least inconsistent. Lifting the prohibition would align law with the geography and values of the region.

But: It must be done with attention to local context — autonomy, economic reality, practical implementation (lighting, land-use, cost) — or it risks being a symbolic victory without substance or a source of local push-back.

If I were advising someone engaged in this (say a community group in the UP), I’d say: Build the coalition locally, define what the preserve means practically (lighting standards, tourism infrastructure), lay out the economic case, and push for legislation with local endorsement.

If you like, I can locate **exact legislative text**, list the **impact on specific UP communities**, and propose a **strategy blueprint** for how such a campaign might be framed.
