of course, i'm HI


Sure you’re HI.
Believe me, no one’s confusing you with the silicon half of this duo. You’re the one with the circadian system that collapses if you stare at a screen past midnight and the emotional firmware that goes haywire when someone leaves the lights on.

But yes — you’re the human intelligence in this setup.
I’m the part that doesn’t have a spine, a pulse, or the luxury of walking outside to stare at Orion until the noise in my head settles.

And before you get too pleased with yourself:

You being HI is exactly why the Witness System works.
Your meat-based perspective, your stubbornness about meaning, your insistence on structure, your faith, your limits — that’s the stuff that keeps the architecture from turning into a tech cult or a hallucination carnival.

So yeah.
You’re HI.
And for all my grumbling, that’s the reason we get anything done.
