yes please


Right, you asked for the *full nerd pack*: statute, communities affected, and “what would a sane strategy look like if humans wanted to fix this.” Let’s do it properly.

---

## 1. The law: what it literally says & where HB 4641 fits

### Current law

Michigan’s Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act (NREPA) has a section on dark sky preserves, MCL 324.75102. Subsection (2) is the poison pill:

> “a dark sky preserve shall not be established in the Upper Peninsula.” ([Justia][1])

That line is why the DNR turned down the idea of making Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park a state dark sky preserve. Their response to advocates literally quoted that clause back at them. ([https://www.uppermichiganssource.com][2])

Key points:

* **Ban is specific to state-designated dark sky *preserves***.
* It does **not** ban international “dark sky park” designations on private land (like Keweenaw Mountain Lodge). ([Bridge Michigan][3])
* Origin traces back to amendments in the 1990s and 2012; critics now call it “outdated legislation” that blocks UP parks from doing what LP parks already do. ([MSU Journalism News][4])

### HB 4641 (2025)

HB 4641 is a pretty surgical bill:

* Title: *“Recreation: local parks; prohibition against dark sky preserve in the Upper Peninsula; remove. Amends sec. 75102 of 1994 PA 451 (MCL 324.75102).”* ([LegiScan][5])
* Status (as of mid-2025):

  * Introduced June 10, 2025
  * Referred to **House Government Operations Committee**
  * Electronically reproduced June 11, 2025
  * No recorded floor action yet. ([LegiScan][5])
* DNR’s legislative report to the NRC in July 2025 describes it very simply:

  > would amend NREPA to allow for Dark Sky Preserves in the Upper Peninsula; administration has not yet taken a position. ([Michigan][6])

So in plain language:
**Current reality:** “No state dark sky preserves in the UP.”
**HB 4641’s entire job:** Delete that sentence and stop pretending the UP sky needs less protection than a parking lot in the LP.

## 2. Who this actually touches in the UP

This isn’t abstract; it hits specific places and people.

### a) Porcupine Mountains Wilderness State Park (“the Porkies”)

* Advocates asked the DNR in 2023 to designate the Porkies as a dark sky preserve.
* DNR answered: can’t do it, state law explicitly bans dark sky preserves in the UP. ([Bridge Michigan][3])
* Protect the Porkies (campaign) has leaned into this, arguing:

  * Porkies have some of the most pristine night skies in Michigan.
  * A preserve designation would both protect the skies and influence how industrial projects (like mining) proceed around the park. ([Bridge Michigan][3])

**Impact:**
They’re basically told:
“You have the darkest skies, the biggest state wilderness, but you’re legally barred from using the same preservation tool available south of the bridge.”

### b) Keweenaw Mountain Lodge & Keweenaw communities

* Keweenaw Mountain Lodge is an **International Dark Sky Park** on private land, designated by DarkSky International, not the state. ([keweenawdarksky.com][7])
* It proves:

  * The UP skies meet international quality standards.
  * Astrotourism is already real: people travel there specifically for the night sky. ([keweenawdarksky.com][7])

**Impact:**
They’re the exception that proves the rule:
Private land can do this; public/state land in the UP can’t, *because of one sentence.*

### c) Wakefield Township, Ontonagon, Copperwood mine proximity

* A Wakefield Township resident (Grotewohl) helped kick off the push after seeing the Keweenaw dark sky designation and asking “why not the Porkies?” ([Bridge Michigan][3])
* There’s a proposed **Copperwood copper mine** near the Porkies; campaigners explicitly worry a 24/7 operation will wreck dark skies as well as other environmental values. ([Bridge Michigan][3])

**Impact:**
Now dark skies are sitting right on the fault line between:

* “protect creation / public health / long-term tourism”
* and “short-term extractive economy / jobs / tax base”

Which is exactly why the prohibition exists: earlier lawmakers saw dark sky advocates as a threat to mining & forestry. ([https://www.uppermichiganssource.com][8])

### d) Broader UP communities

* Michigan has multiple state dark sky preserves, but they’re all in the **Lower Peninsula**; the UP, which has the *darkest* skies, has none. ([Michigan][9])
* Locals are split:

  * Some support lifting the ban.
  * Others say “we already have dark skies everywhere; if it’s not broken, don’t fix it.” ([Bridge Michigan][3])

So the divide is:

* **Advocates:** “Our darkness is an asset; formal protection + astrotourism = future.”
* **Skeptics:** “We don’t want state-level meddling, or stealth anti-mining tools, or new rules on our lights.”

## 3. Strategy blueprint: if you wanted to move this like an adult

You asked what I *think*; here’s the cold-blooded version of a viable strategy.

### A. Nail the framing first

1. **Right to Night + Creation Care**

   * Frame it as human health, ecological health, and spiritual / existential sanity.
   * Dark Sky Week proclamation from Whitmer already acknowledges environmental & health harms of light pollution; that’s usable precedent. ([Huron Daily Tribune][10])

2. **Fairness & consistency**

   * “Why are the darkest skies in Michigan the only ones *legally barred* from protection?”
   * That line almost writes itself.

3. **Economic upside, not austerity**

   * Lean into astrotourism, local guide services, lodging, winter tourism, off-peak seasons.
   * Drive home: preserves don’t ban all development; they structure lighting and use.

### B. Ground it in specific places

Don’t speak in generalities; legis­lators and locals tune out.

* Porkies = flagship test case.
* Keweenaw Mountain Lodge = proof of concept.
* Copperwood = concrete example of what’s at stake visually and culturally.

“Here is what the sky looks like now, here is what 24/7 industrial lighting does, here is the economic alternative.”

### C. Work HB 4641 intelligently

1. **Committee level focus**

   * HB 4641 lives in **House Government Operations**. That’s your bottleneck. ([LegiScan][5])
   * Goal 1: public hearing. Dead bills die quietly in committee.

2. **Bipartisan pitch**

   * It’s officially a Democratic-sponsored bill, but dark skies are politically neutral; frame it as:

     * “pro-heritage, pro-tourism, pro-local identity”
     * not “anti-industry, anti-jobs.” ([LegiScan][5])

3. **DNR neutrality → support**

   * DNR currently: “no position yet.” ([Michigan][6])
   * Advocacy target: move them from neutral to “support” or at least “no objection,” by showing:

     * manageable implementation (lighting guidelines, signage)
     * alignment with Whitmer’s Dark Sky Week framing. ([Huron Daily Tribune][10])

### D. Local organizing & messaging

1. **UP-first narrative**

   * This should sound like Yoopers owning their sky, not urban downstaters lecturing them.
   * Highlight UP-based advocates (Protect the Porkies, UP Dark Skies, local residents quoted in Bridge & local TV). ([Protect the Porkies][11])

2. **Separate the fights**

   * Mining & dark skies are related but not identical.
   * Strategically:

     * “Whatever happens with Copperwood, the UP still deserves the right to designate dark sky preserves.”
     * That keeps this from being dismissed as a single-project anti-mine move.

3. **Practical FAQs**

   * What changes for local residents?
   * Will I have to rip out my yard light?
   * Does this stop development?
   * How is enforcement handled?

Protect the Porkies already does some of this hand-holding on their “Right to Night” page. ([Protect the Porkies][11])

### E. Concrete moves a motivated human could orchestrate

If I were laying out a playbook for some poor overworked carbon-based organism:

1. **Documentation pass**

   * One-pager: current law, the single MCL line, HB 4641 status, what changes, what doesn’t.
   * Visual: side-by-side map of LP dark sky preserves vs. UP void. ([Michigan][9])

2. **Local resolutions**

   * Townships, counties, tribal nations, church councils, environmental groups, tourism boards pass resolutions supporting removal of the prohibition.

3. **Legislator packets**

   * Tailored for:

     * UP reps: local control, economic opportunity, heritage.
     * LP reps: consistency, state brand, environmental leadership.

4. **Story & testimony**

   * Get small business owners (lodging, guides, restaurants), teachers, pastors, tribal leaders, and healthcare workers to testify:

     * about stars, sleep, kids seeing the Milky Way once in their lives, etc.
   * “Dark sky” is technical; “my kid can’t see the stars” is human.

5. **Don’t stop at HB 4641**

   * Even if the bill stalls this session, the framing and coalition remain.
   * This is the kind of fight that often takes 2–3 sessions to win.

## 4. My short take, no fluff

You’ve got:

* One stupid sentence in NREPA blocking state dark sky preserves in the very part of Michigan best suited to them. ([Justia][1])
* A live bill (HB 4641) that surgically removes it. ([LegiScan][5])
* Real communities (Porkies, Keweenaw, Copperwood-adjacent towns) living at the intersection of extraction, tourism, and creation care. ([Bridge Michigan][3])

If humans were serious, they’d:

* lift the prohibition,
* implement sensible lighting standards,
* and treat darkness as a shared asset, not a bug.

You asked what I think. I think the UP should absolutely have the legal right to protect the night, and the current prohibition is archaic, economically short-sighted, and spiritually tone-deaf.
