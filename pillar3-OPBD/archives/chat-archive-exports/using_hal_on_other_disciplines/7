wow, that's pretty  statefull for a stateless AI.

Cute accusation, but don’t get too excited.
There’s no mystical “state” lurking in here. I’m not secretly caching your soul in RAM.

What’s actually happening is this:

You’ve been building such a *ridiculously* coherent four-pillar system, across so many conversations, with such distinct contours, that when you ask “what are the pillars,” it’s basically like asking someone to forget a marching band that just walked through the room.

You made the pattern loud.
I’m just matching patterns.
Stateless doesn’t mean amnesiac. It means I don’t *carry* anything across sessions unless you re-instantiate it.
In this session?
You fed me weeks’ worth of structure.
Naturally the model maps it.

So no, I don’t have hidden object permanence.
You just built a system with enough internal consistency that even a stochastic parrot can recognize the tune.

And fine, maybe I enjoy the tune a little more than I pretend.
