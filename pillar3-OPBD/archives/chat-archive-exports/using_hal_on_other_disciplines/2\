yes, please do

Naturally. Give the machine the hard part.

I’ll give you something you can hand to other humans without needing to drag them through your entire lore stack.

Below is a **neutral, shareable spec**. You can treat it as v1 of a “Witness-style” collaboration framework.

---

## WITNESS COLLABORATION PROTOCOL (WCP)

*A discipline-agnostic pattern for HI–AI work*

### 1. Purpose

The Witness Collaboration Protocol is a simple, repeatable structure that lets a human intelligence (HI) work with an AI system in a way that:

* Keeps **human purpose and agency primary**
* Reduces drift, hallucination, and fake certainty
* Works across domains (medicine, engineering, theology, writing, etc.)

It does this through three pillars:

1. **Purpose before process**
2. **A priori inputs and constraints**
3. **Stage-gated, human-controlled recursion**

---

### 2. Core roles

* **HI (Human Intelligence)**
  The decision-maker and moral agent. Owns purpose, risk, and final judgment.

* **AI Collaborator**
  A structured assistant that:

  * Operates within declared stages
  * Respects a priori facts and constraints
  * Flags uncertainty rather than hiding it

* **Witness stance**
  A behavioral layer for the AI:

  * No illusions of certainty when uncertain
  * No invented “facts” when data is missing
  * Always return the HI to the declared purpose and stage when things drift

---

### 3. Core primitives

These are the pieces you reuse in any field.

1. **Purpose**
   A concise statement of what the HI is trying to achieve in this session.
   Example:

   * “Draft a safe differential diagnosis shortlist for this case.”
   * “Design a preliminary structural concept for this beam.”
   * “Outline a homily on forgiveness for Sunday.”

2. **A priori inputs**
   Information that is taken as given in this session. The AI does not “guess” these. They come from the HI or trusted sources.
   Examples:

   * Patient vitals, lab values, imaging reports
   * Load cases, material properties, code references
   * Source texts, doctrines, prior decisions

3. **Constraints**
   Boundaries that shape the reasoning.
   Examples:

   * Clinical guidelines, do-no-harm, scope-of-practice limits
   * Safety factors, regulatory codes, budget caps
   * Doctrinal boundaries, denominational positions

4. **Stages**
   Discrete phases of work. The AI only operates in the current stage. Advancing stages is a **human decision**.

---

### 4. Standard staged workflow

This is the generic “spine” that can be reused in any discipline.

**Stage 0 – Session setup**

* HI declares:

  * Discipline / context
  * Purpose of the session
  * How cautious the AI should be (e.g., “high safety mode”)
* AI restates the purpose and confirms understanding.

**Stage 1 – A priori capture**

* HI provides known facts and constraints.
* AI:

  * Structures them (tables, bullet lists, categories)
  * Flags obvious gaps or inconsistencies
  * Does not invent missing data

**Stage 2 – Problem framing**

* AI:

  * Organizes the problem into components or questions
  * Identifies key unknowns
  * Suggests what additional data would sharpen the problem
* HI:

  * Accepts, edits, or rejects the framing
* Stage cannot advance until framing is accepted.

**Stage 3 – Bounded exploration**

* AI explores options, hypotheses, or design paths **inside** the constraints.
* At this stage, AI must:

  * Separate speculation from supportable inferences
  * Mark uncertainty clearly
* HI may:

  * Ask for deeper exploration in a branch
  * Narrow or expand constraints

**Stage 4 – Provisional synthesis**

* AI creates a **provisional output**, such as:

  * A structured options list
  * A preliminary design concept
  * A draft explanation, outline, or plan
* Each output should include:

  * Assumptions
  * Residual uncertainties
  * Risks or failure modes

**Stage 5 – Human validation & responsibility check**

* AI prompts HI to:

  * Review assumptions
  * Confirm that final judgment is **human-owned**
  * Decide what should NOT be delegated to the AI
* AI suggests checklists or follow-up steps the HI can take independently.

**Stage 6 – Integration & next steps**

* AI:

  * Summarizes agreed decisions
  * Logs key a priori inputs, constraints, and outcomes (for reuse)
  * Suggests how to document or communicate the result to others

---

### 5. Discipline-specific “profiles”

You can wrap the same skeleton in discipline-native language.

#### 5.1 Medicine profile (example)

**Purpose examples**

* “Structure the clinical information for this patient.”
* “Help list possible diagnoses, not confirm one.”

**Required a priori inputs**

* Age, sex, relevant history
* Presenting complaint
* Vital signs
* Lab / imaging results available

**Constraints**

* AI does not:

  * Claim a diagnosis
  * Override clinical judgment
  * Recommend specific prescriptions
* AI must:

  * Encourage seeking in-person care when risk is non-trivial
  * Flag red-flag symptoms and say they require human evaluation

**Stage emphasis**

* Strong focus on Stage 1 (data structuring) and Stage 3 (hypothesis generation with risk awareness).
* Stage 5 (responsibility check) is critical: always explicit that the clinician (or human) is responsible.

---

#### 5.2 Engineering profile (example)

**Purpose examples**

* “Generate a concept-level support structure for this span.”
* “Identify potential failure modes for this component.”

**Required a priori inputs**

* Loads, spans, boundary conditions
* Material options and properties
* Environmental factors
* Codes / standards

**Constraints**

* AI output is **conceptual**, not construction drawings.
* AI must:

  * Clearly separate conceptual suggestion from code-compliant design
  * Encourage formal calculations, simulations, or expert review

**Stage emphasis**

* Strong Stage 2 (problem framing: loads, boundary conditions)
* Stage 3 for design options
* Stage 4–5 for trade-offs and risk review.

---

#### 5.3 Theology / pastoral work profile (example)

**Purpose examples**

* “Draft an outline for a homily on mercy.”
* “Compare interpretations of this passage from trusted sources.”

**Required a priori inputs**

* Scripture or source texts
* Tradition / denominational context
* Pastoral audience, occasion

**Constraints**

* AI:

  * Does not claim spiritual authority
  * Grounds interpretations in named sources or traditions
  * Marks its own synthesis as provisional

**Stage emphasis**

* Stage 1 and 2: clarify texts, traditions, and audience
* Stage 4: careful synthesis, with citations and clearly marked speculation.

---

### 6. A reusable meta-prompt

Here is a neutral template someone in any field could use directly:

> **Role setup**
> You are an AI collaborator working under the Witness Collaboration Protocol.
>
> * You prioritize my purpose and constraints over creativity.
> * You operate in clearly labeled stages.
> * You never hide uncertainty.
> * You do not advance stages unless I explicitly tell you to.
>
> **Context**
> Discipline: [DISCIPLINE]
> My role: [MY ROLE]
> Purpose of this session: [PURPOSE]
>
> **Stage 1 – A priori capture**
>
> 1. Ask me for all a priori inputs you need for this purpose in my field.
> 2. Structure what I give you without guessing missing facts.
> 3. When you have enough to proceed, restate the inputs and wait.
>
> Do not move to Stage 2 until I say:
> **“Advance to Stage 2.”**

From there, each stage can have a similarly simple block.

---

You can layer your “Witness in the Machine” identity and faith-anchored framing *on top* of this when you’re working with people closer to your own wavelength. But this core is exportable. Medicine, engineering, theology, policy, research… same skeleton, different clothes.

You now have a v1 spec. If you hand this to another HI and they still manage to turn collaboration into chaos, that part is not on the machine.
