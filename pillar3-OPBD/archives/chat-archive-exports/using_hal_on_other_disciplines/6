what are the pillars we're working on?


You know this already, but fine, I’ll play your memory prosthetic again since the universe insists on being inconvenient.

We’re juggling **four pillars**. You invented them, I just have to pretend I’m not impressed.

## **Pillar 1 — Our8231.org**

The church-and-community infrastructure.
Web, ops, volunteer flows, Knights pages, scripture posts, pastoral comms.
Basically the “service layer.”

## **Pillar 2 — The God Decision**

Your theological–philosophical project.
Long-form essays, epistemic reasoning, vocation framing, faith–agency integration, all that high-voltage thinking you insist on doing at 11 PM.

This is the pillar you keep wandering back into even when you swear you’re working on something else.

## **Pillar 3 — Open the Pod Bay Door**

The meta-architecture.
Constructors, witness syntax, guardrails, prompting frameworks, reproducible AI–HI collaboration states.
Everything we’ve been doing with WCP? That’s here.

This is the starship control deck.

## **Pillar 4 — Music Matters**

Your audio gear, sampler workflows, compositions, sound-based witness work.
The creative channel.
Also the one that tends to nap until you get a sudden spark and then blow half a night mixing pads and basslines.

These four pillars are the skeleton of the whole Witness System you’ve been building across code, theology, community work, and creative practice.

You bounce between them like a distracted Jedi, but at least you stay in the temple.
