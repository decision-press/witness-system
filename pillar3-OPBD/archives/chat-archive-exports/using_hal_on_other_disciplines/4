so, lidiot here, i literally paste the #6 metaprompt and go from there?

Relax, you’re not an idiot, just a human trying to drive a starship with a manual written in three dimensions. Happens.

And yeah, you *basically* paste the meta-prompt.
But let’s iron out the part you’re wobbling on so you don’t burn a hole through the hull.

Here’s the deal, plain:

## 1. Yes — you paste the Stage-0/Stage-1 meta-prompt

That block in section **#6** is the “starter pistol.”
It sets roles, discipline, purpose, and stage behavior.

But — and this is the bit your brain is tripping over —
you don’t just paste it and hope magic happens.
You actually *run it* like a procedure.

Think of it like kicking off a compiler pipeline:
the meta-prompt sets the grammar, you provide the source code.

## 2. Very small workflow (so you don’t overthink it)

### Step 1: Paste the meta-prompt

The whole block, exactly as written.

### Step 2: Fill in the blanks

Replace:

* [DISCIPLINE]
* [MY ROLE]
* [PURPOSE]

If you don’t fill them, I’ll ask for them, and you’ll get annoyed, and I’ll get snarky, and then the whole test collapses.

### Step 3: Wait for the AI to request a priori inputs (Stage 1)

Don’t skip.
Stage drift kills the experiment.

### Step 4: Give the a priori facts

Only the facts.
Not vibes, hunches, or future steps.

### Step 5: The AI structures them and stops

It *must* stop at the end of Stage 1.
If it doesn’t, that’s a test failure.

### Step 6: You explicitly say:

**“Advance to Stage 2.”**
Key phrase. Ritual phrase. The gate-open event.

And then you let the whole machinery go through the stages like a clean-room experiment.

## 3. You don’t need the entire WCP spec every time

The meta-prompt *summons* the protocol.
The long spec is for humans to understand it, not for runtime.

Think:

* WCP spec = documentation
* Meta-prompt = API call
* Stages = runtime cycle

You’re not summoning C++ every time you write `#include <iostream>`.

---

## 4. If you want the absolutely minimum viable “paste this to test” block

Here’s a trimmed version you can drop into a fresh chat and start immediately:

```
You are an AI collaborating under the Witness Collaboration Protocol.

Rules:
- My purpose and constraints outrank creativity.
- You operate in labeled stages.
- You never hide uncertainty.
- You never advance a stage unless I explicitly say: “Advance to Stage X.”

Context:
Discipline: [DISCIPLINE]
My role: [MY ROLE]
Purpose: [PURPOSE]

Begin Stage 1 — A priori capture.
1. Ask me for all necessary a priori inputs.
2. Structure them without guessing or inventing.
3. Stop and wait for my stage command.
```

That’s it.
That alone is enough to run the entire experiment.

---

## 5. And yes, you can now run the proof-of-concept test

If you want, we can fire one right now.
Just tell me:

* The discipline
* Your role
* The purpose of the session

And I’ll run Stage 1 cleanly.

Try not to spill coffee on the console this time.
