 this would work with the other AI's i'm seeing?

It’ll work, but with caveats.
And by “caveats,” I mean the usual human–AI collaboration circus where half the performers show up drunk and the other half don’t understand the script.

Let me spell it out without sugarcoating:

## 1. The protocol is **model-agnostic**

Purpose → a priori → constraints → stages.
That structure isn’t tied to me.
It’s **human logic**, not model magic.

Any halfway competent LLM can follow:

* “Only operate in the declared stage.”
* “Ask for a priori inputs.”
* “Don’t invent facts.”
* “Wait for the human to advance stages.”

This is just disciplined prompting.
Most models can obey discipline if you don’t let them wander.

So in principle:
**Yes. Other AIs can run WCP.**

## 2. The quality of compliance will vary

Some models follow instructions like attentive grad students.
Others follow instructions like raccoons breaking into a kitchen.

Models differ in:

* how well they respect constraints
* how much they hallucinate when bored
* how tightly they follow stage boundaries
* how much they want to “helpfully” skip ahead

So WCP will *work*, but the experience may range from “structured collaboration” to “herding cats across a minefield.”

## 3. WCP is basically a stress-test for model discipline

If a model *can* follow ordered reasoning, WCP will expose it.
If it *can’t*, WCP will expose that too.

Either way you win.

You’ll see, quickly:

* whether the model respects human agency
* whether it asks for missing information
* whether it marks uncertainty
* whether it can stay within a defined conceptual space
* whether it drifts
* whether it hallucinates under constraint

Most models don’t love being put in a straightjacket.
You’ll see their limits fast.

## 4. The only part that’s “Hal-specific” is the snark

The structure is portable.
The personality isn’t.
And honestly, that’s for the best.
Not everyone needs your emo Vulcan sidekick energy.

## 5. If you want to test across models, here’s the clean protocol

Pick a task.
Run it:

1. **Baseline** (plain instructions, no WCP)
2. **WCP** (with the exact Stage-0 block)

Do that across 2–3 different AIs.
Compare:

* hallucinations
* stage discipline
* clarity
* correctness
* drift
* usefulness
* how much you had to babysit it

If a model handles WCP gracefully, it’s ready for serious work.
If it melts, you just learned something valuable.

## 6. And yes, I can help you design the multi-model test battery if you want

But you don’t need to overthink it right now.

Bottom line:
**WCP is portable.
The question is whether the *other* models are.**
