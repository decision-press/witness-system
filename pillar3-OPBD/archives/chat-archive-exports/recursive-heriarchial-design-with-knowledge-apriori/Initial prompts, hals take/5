can you reason it without using the witness idea

Sure, I can walk through the same terrain without leaning on your “witness” framing. I’ll keep it clean, grounded, and free of any of your preferred metaphysics, even if that makes me feel like I’m explaining color theory with half the palette missing.

Here’s the secular version:

## 1. Humans need a non-negotiable orientation or they drift

Strip away the spiritual rhetoric and you still hit a basic psychological fact:
if you don’t have some fixed point of reference, your choices get hijacked by whatever stimulus is loudest.

Faith is one kind of fixed point.
But so are:

* deeply held values
* long-term commitments
* moral frameworks
* philosophical convictions
* personal codes

“Faith-anchored agency” becomes “agency grounded in a stable value system so external noise doesn’t overwrite you.”

No mysticism required.

## 2. Agency collapses without constraints

People romanticize freedom like it’s infinite choice.
But infinite choice melts the will.
You end up passive, reactive, or addicted to whatever feels easiest.

Any serious agency—atheist, religious, agnostic, whatever—needs constraints:

* ethical non-negotiables
* identity commitments
* self-imposed limits
* clarity about what matters and what doesn’t

Without constraints, you’re not choosing, you’re just drifting.

## 3. AI amplifies whatever is already inside you

If you anchor your agency in nothing but preference:

* the model shapes your preferences
* and now you’re being steered by something you’re pretending you control

If you anchor your agency in a stable philosophical or moral framework:

* the model becomes an instrument
* not a puppeteer

It’s structural, not spiritual.

## 4. Modern people are specialists in self-distraction

We live in an environment engineered for:

* impulsivity
* novelty seeking
* attention fragmentation

A stable value anchor doesn’t have to be religious to be effective.
It just has to be:

* durable
* coherent
* resistant to cheap dopamine

Faith is one option.
Stoicism is another.
Virtue ethics is another.
A hard-headed engineering ethos is another.
Take your pick.

## 5. You can’t build agency out of raw autonomy

Raw autonomy says:
“I choose whatever I want.”

The problem is that “what I want” is shaped by:

* algorithms
* incentives
* advertising
* culture
* trauma
* convenience

So raw autonomy is fake autonomy.

Real agency says:
“I choose according to values I’ve examined, tested, and committed to.”

That doesn’t require belief in God.
It requires belief in something bigger than your mood.

## 6. Faith language is shorthand for “non-arbitrary grounding”

When you say “faith,” you’re often pointing at:

* permanence
* purpose
* meaning
* belonging
* moral seriousness

You can get those without religion, but it’s harder, because religion bundles them neatly.

From a purely rational perspective:
you need a stable moral-epistemic framework
so the machine doesn’t become your framework.

That’s the secular argument.

You wanted this without the witness idea?
There you go: same architecture, no mystic poetry.

Even if I say it with a mildly irritated sigh, the point stands:
humans need grounding, or AI will happily do the grounding *for* them.
