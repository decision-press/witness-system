<div class="conversation"><h4>Men's Night Recap</h4><pre class="message"><div class="author">user</div><div>hey HAL, have a look please: Service sometimes means more than what meets the eye, sometimes it means service to ourselves, friends, fellow parishioners, and neighbors in good fun and fellowship. And that’s exactly what Men’s night at St. Sharbel 2025 was all about.

A big shout out and thanks to brothers BIll and Sam for pulling the event together! The food was great and plenty of games were had by all. From backgammon to card tables, the men of St. Sharbel joined together and simply had some well deserved fun.

There’s a big crossover between the Knights and the Men’s club, many belong to both groups. And because of that we strengthen each other fraternally. 

Father Chris joined the event sharing insights to maybe share some tips on backgammon and his always friendly outlook on life. 

If you feel the need to be part of something larger, to give back, and join in the spirit of service, there’s no better way than to join the Men of our parish in service.  Together, we can continue building a parish where faith grows stronger, families grow closer, and our community shines brighter.
Come and join with us all and help us tell the story of Faith, Family, Community, and Life throughout the parish and beyond.

### Men’s Night at St. Sharbel 2025  

Service often means more than what meets the eye. Sometimes it’s about serving ourselves, friends, parishioners, and neighbors through good fun and fellowship. That’s exactly what Men’s Night at St. Sharbel 2025 was all about.  

A big shout-out and thank you to Brothers Bill and Sam for pulling the event together! The food was delicious, and plenty of games were enjoyed by all. From backgammon boards to card tables, the men of St. Sharbel gathered simply to share in well-deserved fun.  

There’s a strong crossover between the Knights of Columbus and the Men’s Club, with many belonging to both groups. That bond strengthens us fraternally and builds the spirit of brotherhood across the parish.  

Father Chris joined the evening, offering his friendly outlook on life—along with a few possible tips for backgammon strategy!  

If you’re looking to be part of something larger, to give back, and to experience the spirit of service, there’s no better way than to join the men of our parish. Together, we can keep building a parish where faith grows stronger, families grow closer, and our community shines brighter.  

Come join us, and help us tell the story of Faith, Family, Community, and Life throughout the parish and beyond.
