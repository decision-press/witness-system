Too bad the Lions suffered their second loss of the season. According to sources at BJ’s two theories emerged as to the loss. 1.) Taylor Swift 2.) The Chiefs just weren't about to loose three in a row.

None the less the Lions played some good ball and we all had tons of fun with good food, good drinks, and good company.

Plenty of prizes were had on raffle, and council 8231 raised some funds through a 50/50 raffle. Grand Knight Ed MC’d the event, and we were joined by special guest District Deputy Matt.

Deacon Mike graced the evening, and we got to welcome some new faces.

**Sunday Night Football with Council 8231**  

Big shoutout to Brother Knight Andrew for pulling together a fantastic evening at BJ’s Lounge this past Sunday night! The room was packed with Lions fans (and one brave Packers fan — hold the cheese, please), as fun and family were celebrated by all.  

Too bad the Lions took their second loss of the season. According to sources at BJ’s, two theories quickly emerged to explain it:  
1. Taylor Swift.  
2. The Chiefs just weren’t about to lose three in a row.  

Nonetheless, the Lions played some good ball, and we all enjoyed a great night of food, drinks, and camaraderie.  

Plenty of prizes were raffled off, and Council 8231 raised funds through a 50/50 drawing. Grand Knight Ed served as MC for the evening, joined by special guest District Deputy Matt.  

Deacon Mike graced the gathering, and we were happy to welcome a few new faces.  

All in all, it was a great night — and we hope to see you at the next one!
