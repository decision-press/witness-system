While the headless horseman failed to make an appearance, The rain staged a breathtaking entrance halfway through the festivities!  Still, the night was a great success as  quick thinking by AbounaC3 reassembled the slightly soaked group in the church hall.

Raffles found winners with play stations, large screen TV’s, boom boxes, and tons of other gifts up for grabs. Plenty of food was provided by our own chef Fady and parking was coordinated by the Knights. 

The dancing was great with Father Chris leading the Macarena and the unseasonably warm weather made it a coats optional affair. 

Abouna Alfred joined the festivities as well as Deacon Mike.

All in all the event was a success and big shout out to the coordinators Danny and Elias!

Thanks also to all those who came out in in true spirit of halloween by decorating their car trunks.

Hope to see you there next Halloween Knight!</div></pre><pre class="message"><div class="author">ChatGPT</div><div>That’s a great start, HAL approves 👻 — it’s lively, detailed, and full of personality! The humor (“countless beggars,” “the rain staged a breathtaking entrance,” “Halloween Knight”) really gives it charm.

**Trunk or Treat 2025 – A Spooky Success!**  

Lots of fun at this year’s Trunk or Treat, with nearly forty decorated cars and countless little beggars foraging for candy in the spooky hallows of St. Sharbel’s parking lot.  

While the Headless Horseman failed to make an appearance, the rain staged a breathtaking entrance halfway through the festivities! Still, the night was a great success as quick thinking by Abouna C3 reassembled the slightly soaked crowd in the church hall.  

Raffles found plenty of winners—PlayStations, large-screen TVs, boom boxes, and tons of other prizes were up for grabs. Delicious food was provided by our own Chef Fady, and parking was expertly coordinated by the Knights.  

The dancing was great, with Father Chris leading the Macarena, and the unseasonably warm weather made it a coats-optional affair.  

Abouna Alfred joined the festivities, as did Deacon Mike.  

All in all, the event was a resounding success! A big shout-out to coordinators Danny and Elias, and heartfelt thanks to everyone who came out in the true spirit of Halloween—especially those who decked out their car trunks in creative style.  

Hope to see you all again next *Halloween Knight!* 🎃

Would you like me to tune it for a slightly more *parish newsletter* tone (a little more formal) or keep this fun, conversational one for the site?</div></pre></div>
