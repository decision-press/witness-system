<div class="conversation"><h4>Change to email login</h4><pre class="message"><div class="author">user</div><div>can i change to email log in after using google login</div></pre><pre class="message"><div class="author">ChatGPT</div><div>Yes — you can switch from logging in with Google to using an email/password login, but you’ll need to **set up a password for your account first**. Here’s how it usually works in ChatGPT (and other services with “Sign in with Google”):  

1. **Check your account email**  
   - Your account already has an email address tied to it (the same one you used with Google login).  

2. **Set a password**  
   - Go to the [ChatGPT login page](https://chat.openai.com/).  
   - Instead of clicking “Continue with Google,” choose **“Forgot password?”**.  
   - Enter your Google-linked email.  
   - You’ll get an email to set a password.  

3. **Log in with email**  
   - Next time, you can log in with **email + password** (without Google).  

4. **Google login still works**  
   - Unless you remove Google as a linked method in your account settings, both sign-in methods (Google and password) will work.  

👉 Would you like me to walk you through where in the ChatGPT **Account Settings** you can see/change linked login methods?</div></pre><pre class="message"><div class="author">user</div><div>yes</div></pre><pre class="message"><div class="author">ChatGPT</div><div>Got it 👍 — here’s how you can switch and manage login methods inside **ChatGPT account settings**:

### 🔑 Change from Google login to email + password
1. **Log into ChatGPT** (even if it’s through Google for now).  
2. Click your **profile picture / initials** (bottom-left on desktop, top-right on mobile).  
3. Select **Settings** → then go to **Account**.  
4. You’ll see your **email address** and the login methods tied to your account.  
   - If you only see “Google login” → click **Set password** (or “Forgot password?”).  
   - You’ll be sent a password reset email. Create your new password there.  

5. Once you set a password, you can now log in directly with **email + password**.

### 🔄 Keep or remove Google login
- By default, both methods will work.  
- If you want **only email login**, you can disconnect Google in the same **Account** section under **Linked Accounts**.  

---

### ⚠️ Things to note
- Make sure you still have access to the email tied to your Google login.  
- After switching, always test the email + password login before disconnecting Google (so you don’t lock yourself out).

Do you want me to also show you where the **“Forgot password” link** is on the login screen in case you get stuck?</div></pre></div>
