<div class="conversation"><h4>Hybrid login issue</h4><pre class="message"><div class="author">user</div><div>hey Hal, weird stuff. so when i logged out I actually had to do some hybrid login thing. it didn't give me a forgot password option. had to "try another way" which took me to my google account.</div></pre><pre class="message"><div class="author">ChatGPT</div><div>Yeah, that makes sense. What happened is that your ChatGPT login is tied to your Google account instead of a standalone password.  

Here’s why you didn’t see the **“Forgot password?”** option:

- If you originally created your OpenAI/ChatGPT account with **“Continue with Google”**, then you never had an OpenAI-specific password. The system always defers to Google for authentication.  
- That means logging in (or recovering access) is handled by Google’s security flow — things like *“Try another way”*, email verification, or two-factor prompts — rather than OpenAI’s password reset.  
- The **“Forgot password”** link only shows up if your account is email-and-password based, not when it’s federated through Google, Apple, or Microsoft.

So:  
- If you want to keep it simple, you just keep using **Google login**.  
- If you’d rather have a direct OpenAI password (so “Forgot password” works here), you’d need to go into your OpenAI account settings and set a password manually — but only possible if your Google email isn’t locked to Google-only login. Sometimes you’d have to unlink Google first, then set a password.

👉 Question for you: do you want to stick with the Google-only login (easiest), or would you prefer to set up a separate OpenAI password so you always see “Forgot password”?</div></pre><pre class="message"><div class="author">user</div><div>let me play around for a bit...</div></pre><pre class="message"><div class="author">ChatGPT</div><div>👍 Got it — go experiment a little. If you run into a snag (like it looping back to Google or not giving you the option you expect), just let me know what screen you see and I can walk you through what’s happening under the hood.</div></pre></div>
