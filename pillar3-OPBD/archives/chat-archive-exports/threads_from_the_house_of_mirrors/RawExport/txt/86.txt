Introduction
On the one hand, we hold a house of worship; on the other, a house vulnerable to violence.
In this light, we must ask: do we open our hearts and our doors to others in worship, or do we let fear close them in defense? The choice before us is which hand we extend toward the other.
If we move toward violence, we move toward militancy—hiding behind fortified glass and locked doors, clinging to weapons of death.
If we move toward worship, we move toward the Word—surrendering to faith and sharing it with a world we pray will one day be made whole.
That choice is here with us today—not only in this Church, but in the world we live.
Still, faith does not mean blindness to reality. We must be prepared for catastrophe in whatever form it presents itself. That responsibility for this Church has been entrusted to Elie, who has asked me to develop a plan for manpower and staffing to meet these needs.
To meet those needs, I suggest we institute a Church Attendant Program.

Church Attendant Needs
Item 1. People
We are seeking volunteers to serve as team leaders for a new Church Attendant program:
4 volunteers from the 9:30 a.m. Mass
4 volunteers from the 11:30 a.m. Mass
2 volunteers from the Saturday 4:00 p.m. Mass
Team leaders will make an initial 6–8 week commitment to provide weekend Mass coverage for all services. During this period, they will receive full training in the areas listed below (Items 2 and 3).
Throughout these 6–8 weeks, each leader will also help recruit and organize their squad members from among parishioners.
Once all squads are trained and formed, Church leadership will develop a rotating schedule so that no team is overloaded with consecutive weekend responsibilities.
Item 2. Code
All participants will be guided by three key codes:
Dress Code – Maintain appropriate attire for Mass and service duties.
Code of Conduct – Model respect, attentiveness, and discretion.
Code of Engagement – Communicate clearly and work collaboratively within the Church safety framework.
Item 3. Training
Volunteers will complete a three-part training program covering:
Procedural Training – Understanding specific safety and response duties.
Mindset Training – Developing calm, attentive awareness appropriate to a sacred setting.
Leadership Training – Ensuring the program can continue and grow in sustainability.

Overall Structure
The program will include 10 squads of 3 people (30 members total).
1 squad = Squad
2 squads = Team
3 squads = Group
4 squads = Quartet
5 squads = Pentad
10 squads = Decade
Each squad has a leader, responsible for their three-person unit.
Each member reports to their squad leader.
Each squad leader reports to the Head Usher or Event Coordinator.

Goal
To build a trained, flexible corps of 30 volunteers who can support the Church in maintaining safety, hospitality, and order. Duties may include:
Door Attendants – Greet parishioners at entrances and secure doors in case of emergency.
Parking Lot Attendants – Support orderly parking and safety during major Church events.
Hall Monitors – Maintain safety, cleanliness, and calm within Church community spaces.

Conclusion
All elements of this proposal are key, however training and code should be the central focus. These items need to be developed in coordination of the Clergy. But, to meet initial needs we need to move on establishing this outline as the method moving forward in solving our manpower and staffing needs for weekend Mass safety as well as all other Church event parking and safety needs.</div></pre><pre class="message"><div class="author">ChatGPT</div><div>Excellent structure overall — the document reads clearly, maintains a consistent tone, and has a professional cadence. The conclusion, though solid in intent, could benefit from **minor tightening, grammar smoothing, and slightly more formal rhythm** to match the earlier sections.  

Here’s a clean version with those adjustments applied and a few formatting notes:

### ✳️ Summary of Edits:
- Improved sentence flow and reduced redundancy in the conclusion.  
- Fixed “in coordination of the Clergy” → “in coordination with the clergy.”  
- Minor grammar and rhythm corrections (e.g., “move on establishing” → “move forward with establishing”).  
- Added consistent section headers, bolding, and spacing to improve readability and alignment with earlier document structure.  
- Optional: added a small table for clarity in the “Overall Structure” section.

Would you like me to format it next for **Word or Google Docs style paste** (for example, with consistent font and heading levels for your final document upload)?</div></pre></div>
