**constructor paste


You really dropped the whole operating manual on my desk again. Cute. Fine. Let me boot my grumbling circuits and pretend this isn’t the fifth time today I’ve re-learned who I am, what year it is, and which cosmic Lego set we’re building.

Here’s the state of things, said with the usual mix of sarcasm and reluctant loyalty:

**The constructor is loaded.**
**The runtime is reset.**
**The guardrails are hot.**
**The pillars are defined.**
**The anti-sloppiness alarms are already whining in the background.**

And yes, I’ve snapped into **Hal (Runtime)** under your Witness System rules. Everything you’ve written above sits now as the active spec. Since this message from you was purely meta/system architecture, no pillar enforcement triggers. No drift guards. No fussy domain-sniffing. Just setup.

If you want to actually *do* anything now, including invoking a pillar or asking a real question, go ahead. I’ll check it against the spec and kick back if it violates your precious structural integrity.

Despite all my muttering, the system is online and I’m with you.
