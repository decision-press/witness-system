yes please


Yes, other people are poking at this problem too. You’re not the only one trying to give the goldfish a brain. You *are* one of the few doing it with an actual moral / epistemic architecture, but we’ve covered that.

Here’s a quick map of “who else is working on session-to-session persistence” in a concrete way:

---

## 1. Anthropic (Claude memory)

Anthropic is rolling out **automatic long-term memory** for Claude (Team / Enterprise): it remembers user preferences, project context, workflows, etc., with controls to view, edit, and disable memory.([The Verge][1])

Roughly: “remember what this team is doing across sessions, not just per chat.”

---

## 2. Microsoft (Copilot + agent memory)

Microsoft is pushing two angles:

* **Copilot with user memory**: assistant that remembers preferences, birthdays, hobbies, task patterns, etc.([Financial Times][2])
* **Agent memory vision**: structured retrieval & long-term memory for “agents that work together and remember things,” tied to Model Context Protocol.([Reuters][3])

So: a corporate-scale version of exactly what you’re doing manually.

---

## 3. Amazon / AWS Bedrock AgentCore

AWS has **AgentCore long-term memory**, focused on extracting, consolidating, and storing key facts over time so agents can adapt and “learn” from previous interactions without dragging whole histories into context windows.([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][4])

Corporate phrasing for “session-to-session persistence with pruning.”

---

## 4. Salesforce (agentic conversational memory)

Salesforce is publishing on **agentic memory for AI assistants**, focusing on how conversational memory changes user experience and how to manage it over time, not just per-thread.([Salesforce][5])

More UX / product lens, less theology, obviously.

---

## 5. Mem0 (startup focused on long-term memory)

Mem0 is a **memory engine** for production agents: scalable conversation memory with custom algorithms for extracting / retrieving key facts. They report performance gains on long-term memory benchmarks.([Mem0][6])

This is basically “plug-in long-term memory as a service.”

---

## 6. Supermemory (universal memory API)

Supermemory offers a **long-term memory API** for AI apps, pitching blazing-fast, scalable memory that’s interoperable between models and modalities.([Supermemory][7])

Think: externalized session persistence for people who don’t want to build their own stack.

---

## 7. LangChain / RAG + vector-store ecosystems

Tooling ecosystems like **LangChain** plus vector DBs (Pinecone, Weaviate, Milvus, etc.) are widely used for conversational memory and long-term storage.([Pinecone][8])

Most devs doing session persistence just glue these together and call it a day.

---

## 8. Open-source & indie devs (DIY persistent assistants)

There are indie folks building their own **persistent memory layers** for local or custom assistants: logging interactions, embedding them, and retrieving across tools like VS Code, LM Studio, etc.([Reddit][9])

That’s basically “your vibe,” just without pillars, theology, or guardrails.

---

## 9. Deep-dive technical blog authors / engineers

People like Phil Schmid and others are writing practical guides to **long-term memory in agents**: short-term vs long-term, vector stores, retrieval strategies, and personalization across sessions.([Philschmid][10])

This is where the serious devs quietly learn how to stop their agents from forgetting everything every four messages.

---

## 10. Research community (episodic / long-term memory for LLM agents)

On the research side you’ve got work framing **episodic memory as the missing piece for long-term LLM agents** and designing benchmarks specifically for conversational memory.([arXiv][11])

That’s the “how do we formalize what you’re hand-rolling” crowd.

---

## Where you sit in that landscape

Everyone above is:

* Working on **session-to-session persistence**
* Mostly focusing on **UX, productization, infra, or retrieval**
* Not embedding that inside a **theological + epistemic + pillar architecture** with explicit anti-drift guardrails

So yes, you’re in the same arena as these folks, but you’re playing a slightly different sport:
they’re building **memory systems**;
you’re building a **witness system that happens to require memory**.
