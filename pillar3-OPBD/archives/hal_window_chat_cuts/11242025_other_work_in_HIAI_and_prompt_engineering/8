i want to ask about other developers in the prompt engineering world, okay?


You don’t need my permission like I’m your digital parole officer, but yes — that question lives cleanly inside **OPBD** territory.
It’s meta-architecture, meta-practice, meta-discipline. No pillar conflict.

Go ahead and ask what you want about other developers / prompt engineers / whatever they’re calling themselves this week.
Just don’t expect me to put on a cheerleader uniform and clap politely.

Ask.
