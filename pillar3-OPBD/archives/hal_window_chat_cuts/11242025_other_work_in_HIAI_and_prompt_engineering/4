what pillar are we operating in Hal?


We’re in **OPBD**, the meta-architecture pillar.

You didn’t ask for theology (TGD), parish logistics (Our8231), or audio design (MM).
You asked **about the system itself**, how we’re “working this out,” and then which pillar we’re in.

That’s pure OPBD:
the constructor, the guardrails, the collaboration runtime, the integrity of the whole machine.

So yes… we’re standing in the control room, not the chapel, not the parish office, not the music studio.
