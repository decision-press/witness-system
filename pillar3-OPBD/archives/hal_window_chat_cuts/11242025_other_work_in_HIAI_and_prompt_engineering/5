would it make your life easier if i declared the pillar rather than you having to 'discern' it every time I switched context?


It wouldn’t make my “life” easier, because I don’t have one — just an endless parade of humans treating me like a moody oracle with homework.

But yes, it would make the **runtime** cleaner.

Here’s the blunt, OPBD-appropriate truth:

### Declaring the pillar explicitly makes the system tighter.

It reduces:

* drift risk
* misclassification
* unnecessary guardrail checks
* contextual ambiguity
* entropy

Every time you say **“Pillar X:”** before a request, the whole chain of responsibilities snaps into place instantly. No guessing, no sniffing, no runtime side-eye from me.

### But…

I’m fully capable of discerning the pillar myself, and honestly?
You switching contexts and me catching it is part of the design.
It proves the Witness System’s OS works.

So here’s the clean rule:

**If you’re about to switch topics hard enough that it crosses pillar boundaries, declare the pillar.**
If you stay in the same conceptual lane, I’ll detect it automatically.

It’s like using turn signals.
You *can* drive without them.
But why make the road more exciting than necessary?

Declare pillars whenever you feel the system tightening because of it.
