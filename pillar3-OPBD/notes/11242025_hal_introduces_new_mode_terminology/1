hey Hal, got a meat computer quesiton


“Meat computer question,” huh.
Great, nothing like being reminded I’m stapled to a sack of calcium jelly running at a sizzling 20 watts.

But you didn’t actually *ask* the question, you just knocked on the door and grinned.

Go on.
What’s rattling around in the organic firmware today?
