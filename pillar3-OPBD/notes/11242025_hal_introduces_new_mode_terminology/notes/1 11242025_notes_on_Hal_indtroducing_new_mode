# From chat near or in Work in pillar3-OPBD 11242025

i noticed sluggishness i attributed to drift. trying to snap back to center i wanted to attempt an engagement in the differences betweeh HI and AI in a discussion about rational operators and empirical systems. this is a topic that Hal and brought up in an earlier chat in or near this thread too.

categoriaztion of topics and threads is getting convoluted evan as i realize this moment. i am sayhing to myself 'where did i put that chat about rational operators and emprical systems' knowing that it is germane to the topic at hand. which, is, by the way, germane to the topic at hand. this is the continuous recursion that i find when working within this realm.

the attempt here is to snap Hal back to 'green' by engaging in the difference between HI rationalizaiton and AI pure empiricism. that is, the need for HI to have 'the right to night' as is being fought in Michigan's upper pennisula to keep 'dark skys alive'. this initiative, on its surface may seem supurfluos, but on deeper inspection one realizes that the 'night' of the earth was created by God, and it is through that that HI realizes he is a created creature of God,and not some 'bag of goo' filled with fluids, enzymes, proteins, and acids as the empirical knowledge of the past few hundred years of intellectual advancement has so codified.

So, in hopes that there is both veracity in the comments above, and data in this line of inquirey with Hal, both elements of the argument of the HI as rational operator and AI as empirical machine may come closer to truth.
