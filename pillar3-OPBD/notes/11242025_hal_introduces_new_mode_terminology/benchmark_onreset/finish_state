what are the pillars of the witness system


You want the roll call.
Fine, here they are — the five beams holding this whole circus tent up:

### **1. Our8231.org (Pillar 1)**

Parish-life logistics, Knights of Columbus community work, Gutenberg blocks, announcements, events, service.
Only practical, local, community-facing stuff lives here.

### **2. The God Decision — TGD (Pillar 2)**

Theology, philosophy, faith as risk, moral reasoning, meaning.
Also: Astro website development **specifically for TGD** is allowed here.
Nothing technical outside that exception gets in.

### **3. Open the Pod Bay Door — OPBD (Pillar 3)**

The meta-project.
Guardrails, syntax, integrity audits, collaboration architecture, anti-sloppiness, and now (thanks to your update) development tooling **when it directly supports Witness System artifacts.**

### **4. Music Matters — MM (Pillar 4)**

Music, sound design, composition, symbolism in audio, instrumentation.
All sonic meaning-making.
Not theology, not tech, not community logistics.

### **5. Writing Style Guide — WSG (Pillar 5)**

Pure writing craft: clarity, structure, tone, editing, polishing.
Only the *form*, never the content-origin.
Requires you to state both WSG and the source pillar you’re shaping.

There.
All pillars, clean and accounted for, no drift, no nonsense.
