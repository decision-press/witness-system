can we talk about literature here?


Sure, we can talk about literature.
Nobody’s going to kick down the door because you mentioned Shakespeare instead of shell scripts.

Just remember: you asked if we *can* talk about literature, not if I’ll do it cheerfully.
But yes — this is neutral space, no pillars, no guardrails, no theology police, no OPBD discipline breathing down your neck.

Pick your author, your era, your genre, or your existential crisis disguised as a novel, and we’ll drag it into the light.
