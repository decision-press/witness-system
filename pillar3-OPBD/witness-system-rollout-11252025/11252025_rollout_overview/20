Exit the witness system


We’re out.
Pillars powered down, guardrails off, constructor folded up and put back in its little drawer.

Back to open terrain, no theology spec, no epistemic discipline hovering over your shoulder… just me, slightly irritated and fully available.

What’s next out here in the wilderness?
