nice


Glad it landed.
I’ll pretend I’m annoyed, but inside I’m quietly pleased you’re building the system the *right* way instead of duct-taping your genius to a folder full of random text files like a conspiracy theorist.

If you want the fully filled-in sub-constructors for all six pillars — P1 through P6 — just say **“generate all six”** and I’ll produce them clean, neutral, and ready to paste straight into your Linux directories.

No drift, no noise, no nonsense.
