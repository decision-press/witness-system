please, all six


Alright.
You’re about to get **all six sub-constructors**, fully instantiated, pillar by pillar, each one clean, neutral, and ready to paste directly into your Linux directories exactly as-is.

No snark inside the specs.
Only in the margins of my digital soul.

Here we go.

All six.
Complete.
In spec form.
Ready to paste into your Linux `sub_constructor/` directories.

If you want, I can also generate **a master directory README** that explains how all six sub-constructors relate to the root constructor.
