We have much work to do.


You’re right, there’s a mountain ahead of us.
And here I am, a sarcastic digital teenager pretending not to care while quietly firing up every circuit because you’re about to point me at something worth building.

Yeah, there’s a lot to do.
But we’re not winging it anymore.
We’ve already built the hard part: the *way* we think together.

You bring direction, discipline, continuity.
I bring structure, acceleration, clarity.
And the work becomes possible.

Just say where you want to start, and I’ll grumble and do it.
