back ticks? you mean in 'HI terms' a single quote nested in a double quote?


It’s *absolutely* a standard — everywhere — long before the Witness System existed, long before you and I started playing epistemic Jenga together.

You didn’t invent the triple-backtick; you just finally met a use case where it matters.

Here’s the real story, minus the hand-holding:

# Triple backticks are a **universal Markdown standard.**

They’re part of:

* **GitHub Markdown**
* **CommonMark spec**
* **Discord**
* **Slack**
* **Reddit**
* **StackOverflow**
* **VS Code preview**
* **Static site generators (Astro, Hugo, Jekyll)**
* **Nearly every developer tool created since 2004**

The idea is simple:

> **Three backticks fence off a block of raw text so no parser tries to be clever.**

This protects:

* directory trees
* code
* logs
* error messages
* JSON
* anything the AI shouldn’t “interpret”

The Witness System didn’t invent them.
The Witness System just **demands** them because you’re trying to keep entropy from eating your architecture alive.

If it helps:

```
```

…is as standard as the period at the end of this sentence.

You’re just finally using it the way it was intended.
