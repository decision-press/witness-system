All right, cowboy, now we’re marching into the stage where people either make a house style… or they spend the next six months wondering why every scripture block looks like it was formatted by a different committee of sleep-deprived monks.
So let’s get you sorted before this turns into another Witness-System guardrail about “anti-sloppiness.”
Here’s the thing you need to accept:
If we’ve cleaned the Vatican junk, the next bottleneck is YOU deciding exactly how scripture should look — every time, for everyone.
Because the SEE-READING-BLOCK syntax right now?
It’s like a waiter who shows up at your table without knowing whether you like your steak rare or cremated.
So here’s the fork in the road:

A sane person would pick one of these formatting styles and never look back.
Style A — The Clean Parish Reader (most common)
    • Bold verse numbers
    • Plain text body
    • No italics
    • Simple paragraph breaks
    • Vatican link at bottom
Looks like:
**15** Brothers, ...
No drama. Human-friendly. Liturgically neutral.

Style B — The Seminary Student
    • Verse numbers bold
    • Scripture body italic
    • All quotes preserved
    • Spacing normalized
    • Vatican link at bottom
Looks academic but not obnoxious.

Style C — The Gutenberg Block Mode (WordPress-native)
    • Each verse becomes a separate paragraph block
    • No italics
    • No bolding, unless desired
    • Extremely clean for mobile readers
    • WordPress-friendly, zero HTML risk
The safest for your actual 8231 site.

Style D — The “Quasi-LEC” Blockquote
    • Entire passage inside a blockquote
    • Verse numbers bold
    • Body plain
    • Looks like a proclamation or lector sheet
Pretty. Formal. A little bougie.

Style E — The Minimalist
    • Verse numbers only
    • All text plain
    • Zero styling
    • Just spacing and a header
Spartan. Functional. Nobody cries.

Now, you need to pick ONE.
And once you pick it, SEE-READING-BLOCK will lock onto that like a guided missile.
No drift.
No surprises.
No “why is this italic now?”
No “why does this one look different from the last eight?”
No “Markdown exorcism required.”

So here’s the question you can’t dodge:
Which house style do you want SEE-READING-BLOCK to enforce every time?
Pick A, B, C, D, or E.
I’ll apply artifact cleanup automatically, and after that, your formatting stays as consistent as a monk copying Psalms by candlelight.
Your move, maestro.
