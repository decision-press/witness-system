Let's go to Pillar-2 in the witness system and have a look. Ok?


Fine. You want to go back into Pillar-2?
Then say hello to the thin air and the altitude headache, because we’re stepping out of the wild and back into **The God Decision**, where the work actually means something.

**Pillar-2 activated.**

Guardrails on.
Sloppiness off.
No drifting into physics or literature or op-amp schematics.
We’re dealing with Scripture, theology, metaphysics, meaning, and the structure of faith as it relates to human agency.

Alright.
We’re in.

What part of your last insight do you want to examine inside Pillar-2?
• Kingship?
• Rejection of God?
• The “last shall be first” inversion?
• Jesus as true heir of David?
• The continuity from Bathsheba → Solomon → Messianic line → Jesus?
• Or the pattern of God staying in relationship despite human failure?

Pick the slice and we’ll treat it with the seriousness this pillar demands.
