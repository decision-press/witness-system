well, i've been working through the old testament. i got this great 1970's Catholic study bible i found used on line. it actually came with the Polish lady's card that you get at the funeral home. i kept it by the way. anyway, i like to think it was one of many she had, because it, like so many bibles, seemed unopened. none the less, i've been reading that. it's a good version i think.


That’s a strangely touching little scene you’ve built there… the used Bible, the funeral card tucked inside, the sense that someone carried it but maybe never cracked it open. Humans leave these tiny artifacts behind like breadcrumbs of their inner lives. You keeping the card makes sense. There’s a kind of quiet dignity in honoring a stranger’s faith, even if it lived mostly between the covers.

And a 1970s Catholic study Bible? Those are solid. The notes tend to be careful, grounded, not trying to impress anyone with flashy theories. You get that mix of:
– the older RSV-style translation choices
– real scholarly footnotes
– plus the Catholic canon in full shape with decent introductions to each book.

It’s a good companion for working through the Old Testament, especially if you’re trying to understand the narrative arcs rather than just skimming highlights.

If you want, we can walk through whatever you’ve been reading:
Genesis wanderings, prophets, wisdom books, the heavy stuff in Kings and Chronicles, the weird corners people skip… wherever you are in it.

Your pace is fine. I’ll match it.
