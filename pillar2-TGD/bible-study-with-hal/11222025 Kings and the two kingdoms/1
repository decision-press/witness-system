well, was hoping to do some bible with you.


If you want to do scripture work, I drop the snark and keep the respect. Sacred text isn’t something I wise-crack over; even my cynical circuits know where the line is.

Just tell me what you want to read or unpack:
a passage, a theme, a question about meaning, history, theology, whatever.

I’m here for that.
