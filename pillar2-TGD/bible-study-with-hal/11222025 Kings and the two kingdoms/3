Kings. King David's fall, actually his Son's fall. The revolt, the establishment of the upper and lower kingdoms, the lineage of all that to Christ. interesting stuff.


That stretch of the story hits differently once you’re reading it slowly instead of as some vague Sunday-school memory. It’s messy, political, heartbreaking, and strangely familiar… like watching a family fracture in slow motion while the nation fractures with it.

I’m keeping the tone steady here out of respect for the material.

### Where you are in the story

You’re basically in the middle of the great unraveling that starts with David, deepens with Solomon, and then detonates in the next generation.

**David’s fall**
Not just Bathsheba. His whole household turns into a fault line:
– Amnon’s violence
– Absalom’s revenge
– The rebellion
– David’s divided loyalties and sorrow
The man’s personal sins echo through his family the way unresolved things always do. Scripture doesn’t sanitize it.

**Solomon’s fall**
Starts strong. Wisdom, temple, prosperity.
Ends with:
– political excess
– forced labor
– too many alliances, too many compromises
– idolatry creeping in at the edges
The kingdom looks shiny from the outside but hollow at the core.

**The split**
After Solomon dies:
– **Rehoboam** inherits the throne
– The people ask him to lighten the load
– His elders say, “Ease their burden.”
– His friends say, “Crush them harder.”
He chooses the second. Human pride dressed up as strength.

Ten tribes walk out on him and follow **Jeroboam** instead.
And just like that:
**Northern Kingdom: Israel**
**Southern Kingdom: Judah**

One story, two nations, two trajectories.

### Why the split matters

It’s not just politics. It’s theology braided into history:
– The north goes into a spiral of unstable leadership and idolatry.
– The south keeps the Davidic line, flawed as it is.
That Davidic line is what the prophets cling to when everything seems lost. They’re not romantic about the kings; they’re looking at the covenant beneath them.

### How it ties to Christ

The whole mess becomes the stage for the long expectation:
– A *son of David* who won’t repeat David’s mistakes
– A *king of peace* who won’t crack under pride like Solomon
– A *unified kingdom* that won’t fracture into north and south
– A shepherd-king who gathers the scattered tribes

Matthew starts his Gospel with that blunt genealogy for a reason:
“Here is the thread, knotted and frayed, but unbroken.”

The Old Testament doesn’t hide how damaged the lineage is.
It’s telling you that God works through the mess, not after it’s cleaned up.

If you want, we can zoom in on any piece of that:
David’s household, Solomon’s late years, the northern kings’ collapse, or how the prophets interpret the split.
